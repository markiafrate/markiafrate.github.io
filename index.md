### It's with a heavy heart I share the news that BEX has shut down as of September 15, 2021.

I want to thank each and every one of you who support us over the past 7 years. It has been the ride of our lives watching BEX grow from a tiny platform launched in February of 2014 (remember when we didn't launch with cellar functionality?!) to the amazing community it grew to of over 35,000 members.

I'm well aware of how cliche this sounds, but it was you, the users, that made this community special. Throughout the years I received emails and messages from many of you, expressing how BEX helped you try beers you always wanted to try or how trading helped you make friends you still stay in touch with today. Others simply said thanks for building the platform. Believe it or not, I printed a lot of those out and put them into a notebook I still how (lame, I know). 

Whether you were an Ambassador, avid supporter, or a casual user - you have no idea how much we appreciated your support. It made all the long nights and thought times worth it 1,000 times over.
